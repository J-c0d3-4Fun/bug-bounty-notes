```Although the data transferred through the HTTPS protocol may be encrypted, the request may still reveal the visited URL if it contacted a clear-text DNS server. For this reason, it is recommended to utilize encrypted DNS servers (e.g. 8.8.8.8 or 1.1.1.1), or utilize a VPN service to ensure all traffic is properly encrypted.
